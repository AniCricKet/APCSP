Additionally, pair programming partners is the 1st thing we setup in the Classroom.  It is not because it is easy, it is probably the hardest and most important thing to learn in all STEM careers.</p><p class="post-meta post-meta-title"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-12T00:00:00-05:00" itemprop="datePublished">

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure you can log in and have access to College Board materials.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Typically, I would say lightly review Videos.  This topic is by Jason Han which is one of the CB Teacher I resonate with best.  There is about 11 minutes of video and you need to understand Collaboration better.</li>
    <li>Take notes on topics within your Blog.  Highlight anything that sounds familiar.</li>
    <li>Complete the assigned MCQ questions.</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week is a good time to form the official Scrum Teams for the end of the Trimester project.  This will be our last opportunity for adjustment.  At this time, it is probably best to consider the questions or underlying thoughts alluded to in the MCQ…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is my group setup strictly on the basis of current friends and common interests?</li>
    <li>Is my group setup with diversity in backgrounds, gender, and perspectives?</li>
    <li>Is my group best equipped for the skill sets needed for success in classroom?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Any changes that are agreed upon by the tables and retain balance of numbers will likely be accepted.</p>
