Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . First call sends a different string message | Second call sends a number | . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;teacher&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, ghID, classOf) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable teacher var teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Teacher logItType(teacher); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(teacher.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . Build a Classroom Array/List of Persons and JSON . Many key elements are shown again. New elements include... . Building an Array, &quot;var students&quot; is an array of many persons | Building a Classroom, this show forEach iteration through an array and .push adding to an array. These are key concepts in all programming languages. | . // define a student Array of Person(s) var students = [ new Person(&quot;Anthony&quot;, &quot;tonyhieu&quot;, 2022), new Person(&quot;Bria&quot;, &quot;B-G101&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Allie&quot;, &quot;xiaoa0&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Tigran&quot;, &quot;Tigran7&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Rebecca-123&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Vidhi&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot;, 2024) ]; // define a classroom and build Classroom objects and json function Classroom(teacher, students){ // 1 teacher, many student // start Classroom with Teacher teacher.setRole(&quot;Teacher&quot;); this.teacher = teacher; this.classroom = [teacher]; // add each Student to Classroom this.students = students; this.students.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.classroom.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Classroom this.json = []; this.classroom.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci classroom from formerly defined teacher and students compsci = new Classroom(teacher, students); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci classroom logItType(compsci.classroom); // constructed classroom object logItType(compsci.classroom[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . IJavaScript and Table formatting using toHTML method . This example builds a Classroom method _toHTML which is passed to the IJavaScript interpreter $$.html which renders output similarly to a real website. . JavaScript in the _toHTML method is broken into three parts... Style part is building CSS inline formatting | Body part is constructing the Table Rows (tr), Table Headings (th), and Table Data (td). The table data is obtained from a Classroom object. The JavaScript for loop allows the construction of a new row of data for each person object in the Array. | Return part creates the HTML fragment for rendering | . | The last line in the example $$.html is IJavaScript HTML interpreter and by passing the parameter of the _toHTML method it obtains HTML to render | . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Classroom Classroom.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;background:black;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;GitHub ID&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.classroom for (var row of compsci.classroom) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.ghID + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .",

            "content": "AppLab . App Lab is a programming environment where you can make simple apps. Design an app, code in JavaScript with either blocks or text, then share your app with Teacher or Student Peers. The big limitations of App Lab, that makes it simple, is that the HTML and CSS are not available to developer, thus it is not directly transportable to an independent Web server. . To start, please create a code.org account and click the link . Development and Design Activity . Here are some key requirements for this Activity… . Design and Development activity will start by reviewing a running example application | After review students will design a quiz, 3 question at a minimum. Be sure that a Development design is ready before you start coding | After design students will explore the App Lab programming environment | Students will then work in Pair Programming format and alternate in roles of Driver and Navigator. | At conclusion, pairs will go through a series of reviews. | . Review Running Example . This is an example of an incomplete program. . What could you do to improve this program? | . Design . Come up with your own idea for 3 question quiz. You will be creating your own quiz with a partner on a topic of your choice. The most important thing you do before coding is to PLAN. Make an outline of the quiz you would like to create before you do any coding. . Exploring App Lab . Go ahead and take a look at the interface, discuss with a partner what features you see. | . Console . In the code toolbox click variables and look at: console.log(“message”) Drag this into your workspace. You can change the message if you would like . The message does not print in the app. Where does it print? | Why would it be useful to have a print statement that the user does not see? | . Elements . Make sure you are in design mode and select the elements to drag into the app. Take a look at the changeable attributes of each elements. You can use the workspace to change these manually or you can try to change the attributes with a line of code. . In the code toolbox click UI controls. There are multiple functions that can affect the elements. Go ahead and play around with the different elements and see what you can do. Share something interesting you found with your partner. | How can you keep track of all the elements you created? | . | When you are done: Share your program with the class here | Class programs can be found here | . | . Hacks . The Hack on this assignment is described in the information above . If you finish your quiz early, try coming up with a different concept or idea for an app you think could work within App Lab. Remember to make a plan before you start any coding. | .",

In the Student handout… College Board states that Students need to obtain knowledge and skills that can include, but need not be limited to, “the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. A development process includes ideation, research, reflection, design, implementation, and testing your program. . Scrum Board planning, revising plans, incremental goals, and iterative development are proven methods toward achieving a successful delivery. | Pair Share team needs to work together to optimize delivery to Teacher. | Each student needs to become competent in HTML fragments, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python. | Each student needs to begin technical application of College Board requirements in “Unt 2: Data” and “Unit 3: Algorithms and Programming”. | . Weekly Schedule . Tuesday (makeup Monday): PBL review below; “Live Review” with pairs: show personal progress in ideation and prototyping. | Wednesday: Test Prep - Discuss Create Performance Task. | Thursday: Tech Talk - Code.org AppLab | Friday: Crossover Review last 15-20 minutes with crossover grading | . PBL Ideation . Start the process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding. Ideation are early ideas. . One unique idea, aka something useful to your pair and/or something that helps you in school | Show case work and labs from TPT and TT. | A page that highlights YOU | In this ideation process, it is critical that you Review College Board Create Task project requirements. | . PBL Prototyping . The process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding. Early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development. . This should be done using Pair Programming. A driver and observer, then switching. | . PBL Code/Code/Coding . This is bringing Ideation and Prototyping into something that has function and purpose. . Issues and Coding should show progress to Create Performance Task requirements. | This is a Creative Development Sprint, it is not expected to be finished. However, it should show iterative progress. | . PBL Test . Projects should be tested. Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements (Issues) being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. . Test cases should be developed within Issue before software is fully developed. | Testing and reviews can be combined with crossover grading. | Self and crossover testing and grading should consider how your ‘Unique idea(s)’ matches your Issue(s). | Undoubtedly, after this phase, new Issues are created; these issues represent changes that were not obvious when you started. | . PBL Development . At this point in time… It should be obvious that Development and Coding are not the same thing. Answer the question, “what is development?” or “why do they call people that code engineers?”. . . Progressive learning objectives to become a Development Engineer versus a Coder. Students need to establish a Trimester Long self-evaluation progress sheet on these objectives throughout the term.. Each time you do a review ticket you should consider with of these you have improved on. Proficiency in GitHub Pages/Fastpages and Jupyter Notebooks. Learn how to keep notes, search, tag, and develop code fragments in a personal GH Pages project | Become Active in Classroom Development Methodologies like Pair Programming, Issue Definition, Scrum Boards, GitHub Code Management, Review Tickets, Video making, Lesson Presentation, and Live Grading | Establish skills in Fundamentals of Programming using Python and JavaScript. Understanding Code concepts like Sequences, Selection, Iteration, and Procedural Abstraction | Become fluent in Data Abstraction using Arrays in JavaScript, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Python Lists and Dictionaries | Establish Developer Operations (DevOps) skills in GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Linux, Bash, AWS and other Deployment tooling | Learn how to build the Frontend (JavaScript fetch) and Backend (Python/Flask) Web components of a Web Server. Become knowledgeable in Web Server endpoints and working with JSON. | Develop understanding on how Binary works and how it is the language behind all languages and data. Examine this more in depth through the exploration of binary abstraction used in Images | Relate all of the above objectives to the College Board Big Ideas 1-5 and the Create Performance Task requirement. Start self-evaluation process on GH pages. Additionally, Teachers will administer CB competency via MCQ testing available on AP Classroom | . . . Hacks - Live Grade before Monday AM. . This is a big planning and prototype week, Build all things into Scrum Board. Individuals demonstrate progress on assigned Issue(s) and then complete Issue(s)with tangibles. . DO NOT show up to a review without a Issue(s), mostly referred to as a Review Ticket with links to Tangibles. NEVER state that you don’t have an Issue or Commit because you were helping someone else. This statement will get you a 70% grade at best. | Provide Crossover and Self grade at the top of the Review Ticket. Anyone who rates their work above 90% must have something completed outside of the requirements. | GitHub Page and Jupyter notebooks makes it easy to have a link to your own tangible(s) in a working document. | A high quality Issue will reflect Ideation, Prototyping, Code. It is very easy to take 5 minutes a day to update your Issue before embarking into work. This is called Daily Planning. In fact, Daily Planning will help with your classroom focus | A good way to progress above 90% is to show how you are becoming a Development Engineer. | . | Each Pair performs Review each week with crossover Pair, use review to see if Issue is complete Crossover must make comments and grade within their comment, if individual has not done a crossover grade with comments they will receive 10% reduction on their score. | Individual grade and Crossover grade at top of Review Ticket is required. Make sure you do math on any rubrics provided, grade yourself on everything in the Canvas assignment, it does not matter what the vocabulary is around points and ownership. | If you score yourself higher than the grade you received from Crossover, show how you made adjustment/corrections. | Individual will need to discuss grading and reflection/learnings from crossover grading during their presentation. | . | Each Pair programming partnership should be prepared to complete their review with Teacher in about 2 minutes. Focus is on Creative Development. Be prepared to talk and accept feedback. | Focus on Review Ticket, Demo, Issues(s) completed, Failures, and New Issues Created | Optimize time for where you are the same. | Individuals should each speak to their own differences | Think about your vocabulary!!!

            "content": "EXAM PREPARATION . TAKE THE NOTES! I know the Collegeboard videos are not the most interesting thing and a lot of them cover topics you may already know from class, but just taking simple notes may come in handy when you need to review towards the end of the tri. Also taking notes is very helpful for remembering overall concepts which means LESS REVIEW NEEDED LATER! | TRY ON THE QUIZZES AND PRACTICE TESTS! They are great practice, and searching up the answers is definitely not the way to go. | QUIZ AND TEST CORRECTIONS! They are a great way from you to learn the information if you didn’t learn it from the video. | BUT MOST HELPFUL (FOR ME)…Khan Academy Videos! I found that these videos were super helpful when I needed to review something really fast, but didn’t want to go to collegeboard. I really thought the videos/assignments on the internet were very effective for me. I think its a great resource to use just to review the topics that you are super confused or just want more clarification about. . They’re videos are super quick and straight to the point, which was good for relearning topics I already knew but needed a refresh on. For example, bits and binary was something that I couldn’t remember from the beginning of the year, and the videos helped me remember the basics. | They have assignments/articles for each topic that basically restate the information in the videos but more visually. The unit that covered data security and encryption is a good example of combining the videos and articles, and they definitely helped me understand public and private keys more. | Their practices are also pretty quick and straightforward if you are looking for extra resources other than the quizzes and practice tests. I used the practice tests about the internet because that was something I was not understanding just from Collegeboard practice. | . | THE EXAM . PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTIONS ON THE PRACTICE TESTS! The questions are very similar to what is on the exam. If you know them from the practice exam then you can save up on time from checking your work after you finish. | STARTING TIMING YOUR PRACTICE TESTS! The ones we were given in class were 50 questions. Once you get the hang of the first couple of practice tests, start giving yourself around a hour or an hour and a half to finish all 50 questions. This is gonna help you with pacing and with working under the pressure. | TAKE YOUR TIME! The test is 2 hours for 70 MC. You have time to double and even triple check your answers if you work at a good pace. With that being said don’t stress about not having enough time because you definitely do. | CREATE TASK TIPS . READ OVER THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY! Make sure that you are including each specific element in your project. It might be helpful to make a checklist with everything and check each item off as you are completing it with your project. I found myself having to review the guidelines a lot because there would be little things that I was forgetting, but doing so definitely made my project stronger. | REVIEW THE PAST EXAMPLES FROM COLLEGEBOARD! Seeing what ideas got lower scores guided me and I knew what to avoid including in my own project. Additionally, the good examples gave me some ideas of how other people included the required lists, iteration, and other items in a creative way. Though these examples might inspire you, make sure that you are coming up with your own idea and not directly copying. I looked at example A and B because those examples got all the points rewarded, so I looked at those for what to include and how much to write for my response. | I looked specifically at examples I and H because they both lost a bunch of points, so I made sure not look at what they did wrong and fix those error in my response. | . | CITE YOUR SOURCES! If you use code from somewhere else, dont forget to make notes throughout giving credit to the original creator. Even something as small as a loop needs to be cited if its from somewhere else. But definitely try to code everything yourself because it’s good practice and you learn a lot through actually working through the bugs in your project. | DON’T MAKE A BASIC GAME! This one is more subjective, but a lot of people were telling me that if you make something basic/generic like hangman or tic tac toe you are not going to get a good score. I think just try to be as creative as possible and make sure that your project has a geniune purpose because that’s an important part of the create task. Also please don’t do a GPA Calculator, its so overdone :) | REVIEW THE SCORING GUIDELINES! Don’t just assume you are meeting each requirement, check the guidelines. They let you know exactly what they are looking for, so its another great way to double check your work. | CODE IT ALL AT ONCE THEN REVIEW EACH SECTION! This is also more subjective, but I found it super helpful to code a basic idea of what my create task would look like and all the functionality in one sitting. Then as the deadline approached, I spent a day working through each sections, adding new functionality that reflected the requirements, and refining the code I already created to be more effcient. This was more helpful for me because I had way more time to refine the code and make it way better than that initial draft. | ADD COMMENTS TO THE CODE AS YOU GO! This is something that I wish I did because I ended up forgetting until the last days before the submission. It was not fun having to organize my code and add comments to each line right before the deadline. Adding comments to each section after you write the code is definitely ideal because you can remember exactly what the purpose is. | SPEND A DAY REARRANGING THE CODE! This was important for me because the order that my code was in only made sense to me. But obviously I’m not the one grading, so I spent time going through and arranging my code in a way that I thought would make sense to a random person going through it line by line. | MY CREATE TASK PROCESS LINKS .

Each time we engage in Code/Code/Coding it is an opportunity to think of the possibility of fulfilling the Create Performance Task requirement. But, this is a student project and responsibility is on you. To be thinking and preparing is a mindset, one that Del Norte CompSci Teachers advise as we proceed through topics. Thus, we are getting and early start by using this Pair Share project as an iteration through the entire process, as that is the foundational principle behind PBL. . Teacher will help as directed by College Board… . Provide instruction, practice, and feedback related to content and skills that will help students succeed on the performance task. This can include, but needs not be limited to, the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. | Brainstorm problems that programming can address or brainstorm special interests that students want to incorporate when developing a program. | Assist students in defining their focus and choice of topics without making selections for them (e.g., by asking questions). | Review the performance task directions and provide multiple opportunities to practice and discuss the entire performance task and individual prompts of the task. | Explain the role the teacher can and cannot play in providing students with assistance during the actual performance task; teachers should encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity to get assistance and feedback from teachers and peers during practice. | Review the scoring guidelines with students to help them understand how their work will be assessed. Teachers should remind students that the scoring guidelines align to the prompts in the performance task, so they must respond to all the prompts in their attempt to obtain the highest score possible. | . Disclaimer. Del Norte Computer Science Teachers are not experts in College Board scoring guidelines. It is best to look for examples of performance task submissions at high, medium, and low levels on College Board Web Site. Any grades you receive on any project in class may differ from scoring of the performance task by College Board. . General Requirements, from CB Exam Description . Prior to the official administration of the Create performance task, students need practice implementing programs that first include sequencing, then incorporate selection and iteration, and finally use procedures and lists. While collaboration on ideation and program design and development during the Create performance task is not required, it is encouraged. . You will be provided with a minimum of 12 hours of class time to complete and submit the following: . Final program code (created independently or collaboratively) | A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently) | Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently) | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers are requiring students to do collaborative ideation, program design, prototyping and pair programming on these early activities that we grade in class. . Create Performance Task Skills and Rubric Breakdown (Out of 6 Points) . Note: There is no partial credit (0 or 1 point for each section). AP Computer Science Principles Exam is a through-course performance task that assesses Computational Thinking Practices 1, 2, 3, and 4 across six rubric rows. . Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . Assesses students’ ability to explain how a code segment or program functions. (Skill: Code Analysis) | For 3a, make sure to differentiate between program purpose and function They are defined in the scoring guidelines | . | . Row 2: Data Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - data) | . Row 3: Managing Complexity .

(Skill Abstraction in Program Development explain complexity) | Be specific about how the program manages complexity in the context of your own program | . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . Assesses students’ ability to use abstraction to manage complexity in a program. (Skill Abstraction in Program Development - procedures/functions) | Must be a student-developed procedure | . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Assesses students’ ability to implement and apply an algorithm. (Skill Algorithms and Program Development) | . Row 6: Testing . Assesses students’ ability to investigate the situation, context,or task. (Skill Computational Solution Design - testing) | . Collaboration Rules, from CB Q&amp;A . Collaboration happens when two or more students are actively engaged in the development of a program. Some examples of acceptable ways to collaborate are as follows. . 2 students who are writing the entire program together, perhaps using pair programming. | 2 or more students who have divided a larger, more complex program into different separate parts, each writing their own part and then assembling the pieces into the finished program. | Student(s) giving feedback on an independently or collaboratively written program. | Student(s) providing debugging assistance to another student or collaborative group of students. | . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers want to see all of these prescribe methods of collaboration utilized. . Collaboration without Plagiarism, from CB Q&amp;A . If students are combining independently written program code with another student, they should cite that the program code is written by a collaborative peer. To protect the anonymity of the collaborative peer, students simply state that the portion of program code was written by their collaborative peer, rather than putting the names of themselves or their collaborative peer in the program code. . When completing the Create performance task, students will need to add substantial revisions and additional functionality when starting with preexisting program code. Simply changing an image in a game or the names of variables is insufficient. . Del Norte Computer Science Principles Teachers have zero tolerance for plagiarism. Misrepresenting your own work and not attending class (without makeup) are the only ways to get less than 70% in the class. Plagiarism is 0%, being in class is 50%, any individual effort with attendance gets 70%. The biggest jeopardy to getting a bad grade in the class is getting a 0%, the only possibility of such is plagiarism or missing class without makeup. .

In our Fastpages/GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done. Jekyll takes our choice of layouts in our _config.yml file (theme: minima), along with our HTML and Markdown fragments and build a complete static website. . Web Page Layout . A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates). . Web Page Layout. This illustration becomes important when you make your own layout and fragments using frameworks like Jinja2 (for Python) or Thymeleaf (for Java). | The design of GitHub pages allows us to change themes with the _config.yml file (theme: minima) key/value, change the value to a supported theme and page should work, but will look different. | Minima theme, click on link for accurate syntax. Everywhere you see an “include” this layout is including a fragment to complement the page, things like CSS, JavaScript, headers and footers are included into the layout. Where you see “content”, this is the statement that includes page specific fragments we have designed added within the layout. You should associate all of this to “Procedural Abstraction”. | . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &quot;include head.html&quot; &lt;body&gt; &quot;include header.html&quot; &lt;main class=&quot;page-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Content&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &quot;content&quot; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &quot;include footer.html&quot; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Alert to Students . Students spending majority or large portions of time writing custom CSS will be counter productive to College Board goals and CTE goals for this class. Be aware that HTML style is important, but we are trying to focus more on utilizing framework (GitHub Pages) to maximize our success in the style area. Developers, particularly new Developers, need to ensure they are spending majority of time in the key technical of instruction. Pair Programming and Team Programming are aids in speeding up learning, these collaborative techniques are not defer key technical learnings to others!!! In 2021-2022 several students lost a grade at the end of the trimester because they were out of balance and were solely focused on CSS/style. . As an illustration, look at the minima them. Look at the analytics and work that went into it. Leverage off it, don’t recreate it! . Review these Fragments . Table Fragments . In Fastpages you can build a table in HTML or Markdown. .

Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills .

Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. IIf you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do.. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research.

            "content": "Data Abstraction - Week 2 . As you use Python, as with all programming languages, managing data is a key skill. Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Or in other words, something that is easier for the developer to understand. Data Abstraction ,along with Procedural Abstraction, are the keys making successful programs. Data Abstraction is vital when sharing data amongst developers, sharing data across the internet, or working in technologies like BioMed, Data Science, etc. . Variables are a way to name, store, data and reference data. We have started working with variables in our last sprint. Lists and Dictionaries are variables with extended features for storing and retrieving data. Lists, think of [] square brackets, are a way of grouping data in an ordered sequence, and will be a big part of the requirement for the College Board Create Task project. All students will need to become proficient in lists to do well in the class and succeed in the AP exam. | Dictionaries, think of {} curly braces, are a way of grouping data into in key-value relationships.

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[0]&quot;, langs[0], type(langs[0])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints... Would it be possible to output data in a reverse order? | Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? | Could you create new or add to dictionary data set? Could you do it with input? | Make a quiz that stores in a List of Dictionaries. | . | .",

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files.

Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site.

            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Python using print and input commands (aka anatomy). . Print command using Static Text which performs output . The classic introduction to a programming language is to output a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the print command. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | Output in Jupyter Notebook is below the code cell. Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically outputs to a terminal, we will see that when students start using Visual Studio Code. | . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable &quot;msg&quot; is part of both statement The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used to capture the input command | The variable &quot;msg&quot; is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal, or in Jupyter Notebook below the code cell. | . | The &quot;input&quot; command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the &quot;msg&quot; variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the &quot;msg&quot; variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | Input and Output in Jupyter Notebook Input is NOT in line with Output, this is a little annoyance and requires familiarity. Input and Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically obtains input and outputs to a terminal, students will see that when they run Python programs using Visual Studio Code. | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The &quot;def question_and_answer(prompt)&quot; now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is &quot;question_and_answer&quot;. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three &quot;question_and_answer&quot; commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique &quot;prompt&quot; as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called &quot;prompt&quot;, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation &quot;+&quot; prefixes the prompt with the literal message &quot;Question: &quot;. | The &quot;msg&quot; variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input &quot;msg&quot; is output back to the user with &quot;Answer: &quot; concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see an ordered list of commands, what would you call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that are developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command in this example is used to evaluate a response?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hacks . Test running a Python file directly . From python directory run quiz.py in VS Code, this will show workflow of Input and Output in terminal | . Build your own Jupyter Notebook meeting these College Board and CTE competencies . Build your own quiz, including my questions and show outputs | Create both Markdown for description and Code for execution | Structure your Python code with comments &quot;#&quot; to complement Markdown descriptions | . Additional requirements . Build your quiz so that it captures the key Vocabulary from this Jupyter document | Calculate the percentage of your quiz | Review College Board Big Idea outline, see if you can reference locations in Markdown that support vocabulary | . Extra credit, Advanced . Do you see repeating pattern of code? Try to implement solution to avoid the repeating pattern (hint: list and iteration) | .",

A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. Add Jupyter Notebooks (computational documents) and you bridge Computer with Data Science. The beauty of Jupyter is that it creates a computational narrative, a document that allows code and data with visual analysis, hypothesis, and conjecture. . Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. | GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. | Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. | . | Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, the former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. | Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”. | .

The notation we look at is supposed to be easy for the user and their application. For instance, many new languages are being popularized around data science. It is more important that a Data Scientist is successful in their task, than to learn syntax that is not familiar to their traditional workspace. .

It is very important that you become fluent in “Command Vocabulary” and “Purpose” of the Pseudo Code versus Python comparison. During the year you will look at JavaScript which has same Command Vocabulary and Purpose. Others may take Java, you will see the same ideas again. . Start building Vocabulary and Purpose by Code/Code/Coding | Supplement you Code with comments and outputs using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This style allows you to code explore and learn as you go. | Use CB pseudo code as part of your definitions as you build your notebooks. | . Hacks . Build your own Notebook to highlight what you want to capture on pseudo code | Add a link in your Notebook to College Board pseudo code reference and other materials you find interesting by searching the internet | .",

Ms Naidu and Mr Mortensen often had positive work sessions at the end of the day and we were always complementary to students effort. | Test Prep Tuesday was polarized between participating and not participating. Student Led sessions needed improve, perhaps more training by Teachers. In 2023 testing year, the plan is to lead Test Prep sessions at start of the year and look for students to provide valued participation in second half of Trimester 1. Extra Credit will likely be awarded for quality student led preparations during the year. | Students did very well on practice exams and on corrections of errors. Majority of class was in dark green after 2nd practice test. | Some students were trying to do minimum on College Board Create Performance Task (CPT). The people that received “4’s and 5’s” seem to have an extra mindset on CPT. It is my opinion that many scores dropped out of “5” range as a result of the CPT. But, this can’t be confirmed, but theory is based on high MCQ scores in practice sessions. | . . . 2021 . Pandemic and online exam in lock down browser, MCQs . Scrum Teams were standardized at 4 to 5 people, based on CSA experience. Connections in Scrum Teams were inconsistent throughout the year, a lot of black screens. | A few students took on Student Led Test Prep Tuesday and produced prepared lessons. | A few students seem to do most of the work in Scrum Teams. There were many mentions of this in teams that were more open to their internal problems. | Based off of inconsistent participation, scores did not surprise the Teacher. | Stats show there is no left in this graph, very successful class. | . . .",

Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP | Follow up dates. Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18 | Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O&#39;Masters (Central Valley) | Worked with Sean Yeung who is new to my school :). I would like to see a lot of him this week. | Lesson 3 Plan What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan? Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary. Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s that students will see in future. Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... &quot;to make sure the work gets done&quot;. | What are 2 things you have questions about? I believe 15-18 age group should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes). Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don&#39;t get binary directly. IMO, binary should be taught in detail when needed, my plan is to teach it through color codes and through binary calculator; the later inspired by Harvard CS50. IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don&#39;t want to lead students down the binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary as part of an application solution. College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression. | What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson? Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or course vision. I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic. Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other. Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2. | . | . . Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Binary Number System slide #99. The activity requires paper and Teacher thinks analog experience is important. Connect Circle-0 / Square-1. Teacher recognizes different experience level but thinks everyone should create flippy-do. Code.org vocabulary is last, but not to be ignored. . Relation is focussed on these concepts 0-9 are symbols for numbers in Base 10 | 0-1 are symbols for numbers in Base 2 | . | Make an adaptation to support Flippy-Do information: Binary Calculator | The 2048 game might be interesting development activity to relate to binary. | This is a general slide on all lessons slide #121. | Color Codes inserted into these lessons seems key to me, or some other purposeful element, encryption was mentioned by Teacher. In general, not seeing “why?” in Code.org lessons as we start… but the appear in the high level description. | . Compare Unplugged and Plugged Lessons. . What is teacher doing in unplugged lesson? encouragement, walking around, answering questions. Unplugged is not computer: Stand-up meeting, White Board Design | Let them Explore!!! Shared an idea of plugged lesson, shared a tool. Don’t lecture about it, as them what it does, what is happening? | . Teachers role is described as Lead learner. We may not know, but we can figure it out. My response to questions… . Lead learner allows diverse activities in classroom | Lead learner may provide completely different work for student with special interests or special needs. | Teacher (Jennifer) suggested she needs to build the computer science muscle, including suffer confusion. Student (Patrick) mentioned that students see straight into your capability. | Different rhythms for different students. | Blogging Platforms mentioned | Peer Feedback mentioned | Pair Programming mentioned | . Actions for inclusive classroom culture . Group thought it is more on capability versus culture | Student (Sonya) talked about doing multiple media types (paper, digital) | Student (Patrick) discussed audio and video slides for virtual | Student (Ken Toma) give everybody a voice. Suggested pair-share can provide that platform | . Async work . This video discusses a lot of what I believe in and will kickoff PBL well. I think it popped up by accident but it was cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s29LKfEFjQ | Watched the place, mostly it has a place to complete async activities and surveys. It says I am not enrolled when I attempt survey. | The Place introduced. | . Tuesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Module 2 Intro Slides . USC represented shared Web Site | Unit 1 Lesson 7. Played with B/W Widget, on building black and white images. Idea was good on 1st couple of exercises, it quickly seemed to become tedious. I am not sure how it would related to key concepts in CB and not happy with it in PBL (except if we add improvement or design elements). Interaction could be improved to maintain orientation of Hexadecimal to lines. Maybe coding improvement could be to preserve orientation and allow clicking on pic, binary, or both. This exercise in driver navigator would make a lot of sense. Worked with Jp Fletcher, Jason Mahoney, Manuel Hernandez | Unit 1 Lesson 8. Color Images Widget, I like this for the 1st lesson more. It seems like the stair step is not significant and perhaps this might provide more joy. Somewhat a combination of two lessons would make me happier, perhaps one black/white and then color would be good for interactive lecture.

Learning objectives and essential knowledge. | Async was on Big Ideas, Computational Thinking practices,… In my experience I focus in on covering the Big Ideas. Students don’t seem to relate will to other weightings. Also, I focus on CTE principle of College Ready through test and Intern ready through PBL. If we teach them to build stuff a lot of the other things fall out. | . Tuesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Kickoff was reviewing scavenger hunt. People generally have questions as new teachers. . Teacher (Katie) reviewed CB outline. My experience is by doing CB MCQs and PBL, the students think questions are easy/basic. | Next (Katie) covered the Code.org outline. Unit 1-3 cover Big Idea topics in 1, 2, 4. Units 4-7 cover Big Idea 3. | Some discussion on block coding vs scripted in Create Task Project. | . Transition to Unit 1 Lesson 9-10 Lossless/Lossy Compression. Widget Bubble 1 . Played with Text to Symbol compression, Ken Toma came up with multiple words. | Spoke on introduction, we instructed Patrick to look for associations to make this interesting. | Lossy compression had a reduction widget | Lossy compression had a pick quality slide voting | Summary on these, widgets and ideas are great for intro, but they don’t seem to have depth that I like in the lesson. I want people to learn how to do these. | . Async session had a video that shared review of things we missed in workshop versus code.org curriculum. This filled some gaps that I thought were missing in order that we followed. . How you interact with the World. | For tomorrow, there is talk of Internet Simulator / Messaging System that may be good illustration and complement to a Tech Talk. I wonder, do they provide code for these tools? That would be a great thing to teach students to make, it looks like it works over sockets because of instant refresh. | . Wednesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Internet Unit A new day of slides . Paseo Reflection . Strongly: identify Coach, Parent | Life Advantage: Being Chinese, Entrepreneur | Equity: Teacher, Coach/Teaching | Feel, Identity: Balance on sharing (ego heavy, selling short). Mental health and physical health are important on reflection, feeling selfish. Give people benefit in process of their evaluation. | . Network Challenge. This is the challenge that was familiar to classroom and Colin made this as an app a couple of years ago. . Two people share a line | Multiple connections from persons to lines | Teachers are holding a lot of stock in simplicity and activity. Though, Network are multiply connected to routers and not computers and Network design is complex. It should be clarified that most home computers have a single router. A,B,C,D,E should be conceptual. ISP typically have multiple paths and home networks do not. It is interesting that Group 4 used a hub, challenge #3; this tells me that people are going to think it is computers. | . IP Addresses and DNS. Started by making a series of appointments. Not much purpose of this other than addressing names and getting a response. Creating a packet of data (Monday, Cheanie) response (OK). . Async work . Mental pictures Blind spots, accept you have them and work on them. Female: delicate, caring family | Male: career, strong, powerful | . | Article summary is holding ourself accountable for bias, as I am sure I have some bias that is reflected in my work. However, I believe most of my personal bias has to do with classroom behavior of the individual. Other notes: sometimes students are looking for bias | Difficulty: those that have history (good or bad) in a year long classroom have difficult going good to bad or bad to good in my eyes. Certainly someone who starts great gets a lot of my respect and favoritism. | . | Digital information dilemmas, game companies can’t use Lebron James tattoos. There is so much copyright, I am not even sure I can take notes and represent pictures, but I do it. | . Wednesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Network Simulator and Bias . Network Simulator would be really fun if code was available. I think I would like to mimic it for a development project. Students really resonate toward building this type of thing. It could be built on top of Logging and Image thing. | Bias discussion and my problems exists or are established on behavior. I have favorite students and even invite them into Nighthawk Coding Society. Or they invite themselves. | Student attitude may have something that needs exploration. | . Async work is mostly a couple of videos and ability to comment on the material. These are particularly good ideas and are somewhat built into GitHub pages. . We should have students comment on most of the lessons or the day after the lessons. This could be a great way to obtains some feedback in context. | Network simulator may be a tool that we could build in class, it would be an interesting project for a team that wants to code. | . After hours work. Because of discussion of awarding people on doing things conversation, plus many asking questions about how to score on doing things… I went back and updated hacks and worked with Sean on getting comments working on Tools Setup. IMO, this solves problem of presenting, providing what to do, and capturing in the same place. . Thursday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Who Belongs in CSP? Thursday Slides . Unit 3 Bridge to programming units starting with Lesson 2 Design Mode, student work in AppLab | Stocks, has several rows and columns. It show a graph and has current price. If you click on a stock it takes you to articles written about the stock | . MSFT /graph 274.17 AAPL /graph 155.98 . Block coding tool is big focus. Pace is slow. | Design session introduced JavaScript commands. It showed onEvent with a function. There is kind of a confusing design and tool back and forth, mostly presenter and online issues. | . Async very quick example that seems to beg for me to say yes to intervention. But IMO, there are bigger fish to fry than someone knowing a stats answer. . BTW, we saw many mistakes presented in Networking lines game, but people were not speaking up. Sometimes it is best to let people just have an answer. | Debugging was topic in video. Positive “make mistakes message”, goes with grading comment made to have check boxes for points, not right or wrong. Learning is a process, everything does not need ot be corrected. | . Planning notes for an Application like the Birds sample, mostly use their code with minor adaptations… . - Stock Quiz - Start Screen Begin Button — 1 — What is most valuable stock on US exchanges? Apple (AAPL) and three wrong — 2 — What is Robin Hood darling stock in 21-22? Game Stop and three wrong — 3 — What is a good philosophy in market? Buy low Sell high and three wrong — Winner Screen — Congrats. Here are some tips before you go invest… Open, Close, Day High/Low, 52 week average — Wrong Answer Screen — Try again, wrong answer. You must get the right answer to continue (move on). . Thursday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm . Lab work. Best link for AppLab. My biggest observation was not about the lessons, it was about the cohorts and their Lab work. Many of them were with very excited about their creations. AppLab made some successful and really picked up their excitement. I think Wednesday was a downer for me and perhaps a lot of others and it carried with me into Thu. Today many spirits were lifted. . IMO, Tech success lifts spirits | Teacher cohorts like to see that they coded. AppLab example on QA’s seems to be very intuitive for new coders. I know students like a Quiz and they can lead into Data Analytics, so it is not a bad thing. | I was helping someone that was very new (Patrick) and he seemed to have some intuition about things like Label, Text Box, Button. | Less intuition on Sequencing and Events. Perhaps their should be a little intro to these structures, like placing code inside of events. Also, my view was a little difficult so it was difficult to be a great Pair Programmer as I should have caught some extra clicks in producing excess code. | Finally, Pair Programming is an interactive two brain process. It was weird to hear facilitator talk about Driver/Navigator as if Navigator is more in command position. | . Friday Morning Session 9 - 11 am . Saturday Oct 15, Dec 3, Jan 28, Mar 18 workshop days. . Equity in CompSci Classroom. Sindie talked about zero experience, not only the smart student. . Work load. (Asian, 50% Indian) Mental health is a bigger focus for this year (work load management, more in class work, but lots of information at the beginning of year) | Sonya parent pressure, grade 1st (Korean) Debugging the Gender Gap (video), “what does a coder look like?”. | Jason variety not just group work (Hispanic) | Patrick email: Patrick.davis@inglewoodusd.com | . Assessment changes . Here is instructors percentage guide | Many seem to NOT have a system for this as they don’t have a vision of what they will teach yet. | . CTE/Admin Report with focus on Pathway . Regarding CompSci Pathway, there are no standards. Districts and even schools pick. . My understanding is Districts pick their Curriculum Provider and it often requires Teachers to get a certificate. Code.org is fulfilling district/certificate requirements. Code.org is providing a completely closed platform with its own LMS and tools. | USC and UCSD attachments to Code.org are both using an ncsu.org. NC State system to aggregate teacher completion, for example async work must be captured in the tool. My thoughts are USC, UCSD, NC State are involved in some sort of grant program as an individual pops in and promotes on campus events and opportunities for teacher to get certificate that will help boost pay. There was a USC off campus host managing the class, they are giving Teachers some swag and hours toward certificate. Teachers at training had little and mostly no CompSci experience. | . CS Discovery is a Code.org brand. According to PLTW web site their brand is Essentials. . College Board Lists Curriculum Providers | From Code.org What is CS Discoveries CS Discoveries is designed to fit naturally between our CS Fundamentals courses and our CS Principles course | Computer Science Discoveries is an introductory computer science course for 6 - 10th grade students. | . | From PLTW.org the name is CS Essentials This lists Essentials, Principles, A, Cybersecurity | Principles description has Cybersecurity emphasis | . | . Of course College Board is another business which in turn is advertising groups like Code.org or PLTW.org. However, the are also list Apple which is listed as a provider of curriculum for CompSci Principles. This is kind of fun for me, as it goes back to my Intro year, but this content can be used for CS Principles. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles curriculum helps students build a foundation in programming using Swift—a powerful and intuitive open source programming language designed by Apple—while preparing them for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. Students will get practical experience with the tools, techniques, and concepts needed to build an iOS app. They’ll learn about the impact of computing, privacy, and security on society, while exploring the technology behind their own activities through interactive stories. Develop in Swift AP CS Principles includes a student and teacher guide available for free on Apple Books. Downloadable Xcode and Playground project files are also available to support the curriculum activities . Back to CTE, the students and teacher. Teacher motivations can vary. My philosophy is teach content and test will fall out. Yesterday I had a Teacher in our breakout say to me… Bottom Line, I want all my students to get 100% on AP exam. End of story. But, I don&#39;t think the Code.org platform, the training I got, and me are going to make it happen. A Student was working with me yesterday and we were dialoguing on Slack. He was working with me on something wrt his internship that was related to certificate deltas between Windows and MacOS. I told the student about my Code.org training I don&#39;t really like the code.org method. My friend goes to a different school and took AP CSP using that curriculum. I personally was unimpressed with that I told the student that I was looking at a softer entrances into PBL I don&#39;t think code.org is the solution, coming from a student perspective. You might want to take a more traditional class approach by teaching everyday at the beginning, which is what students are used to. Then ease into PBL Also, yesterday I had several students working with me on next years classroom tooling. From this experience, all students had their own blogging and tooling platform. IMO, Student are the center. Thus, object should form around student. Not Code.org or LMS. This means they need their own tools and their own objects. This means an open platform to express their engineering . Summary. Sharpen the sword is a phrase used in habit of highly successful people. I learned a lot during the week from Code.org training and platform. Also, I got great exposure to many new teachers entering into Computer Science. I am happy that there is something for these people to grab onto. Also it helped me provide a lesson idea for Sean in our 3rd week (related to interest in block coding). But, for me this is a case of sharpening the sword, there is no intention to adopt the entire curriculum. I hope to continue with my existing approach to CSP curriculum: PBL, Open Platform. Sword sharpening includes: adding softer entries to topics, more traditional lectures in Trimester 1, build muscle for longer term PBL. .",

CS-Students is a sample knowledge graph that can be used to model any classroom that is relation based (a classroom that has lots of different people, pairs, groups, periods; things like that). This notebook is meant to demonstrate how to query this knowledge graph based on the preset things that are currently in the sample data. . Data . Currently, the data consists of the following categories (which are labels in Neo4J): . Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods) . Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period) . Pairs (pairs of students within scrum teams) . Person (object that represents each student) . The data also has the following relationships . IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in) . CROSSOVER (a relationship that exists to connect pairs of teams which work together) . PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together) . IN_GROUP (to relate people to the group they are in) .

Deployment is the tools and service used to enable the Web Application on the Internet. The process of can use many different cloud servers, as well as choice in tools and services. . EC2: Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform that the PUSD district has provided for us to serve our Web Application. | GitHub: At this point in time, we should be aware that we are using GitHub is an open platform to share our Web Application code on the Internet. | Docker and docker-compose: To host a Web Application you need to prepare an environment that contains the Web Application code and all the dependencies (requirements.txt for Python) Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. | Nginx: To find a Web Application on a server, there needs to be a process to listen for the Web request and direct it to the Web Application. Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxy, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. | Certbot: Web traffic on internet is reliably served over Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (https). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using Let’s Encrypt certifications | DNS: Natively, the web works off of IP addresses. Domain Name Services (DNS) allows the assignment of a friendly name to our Web Server. This name is built into Nginx/Certbot configuration files. Freenom is the service used to register the nighthawkcodingsociety.com domain. | . Key/Values required as you go through these procedures . Listed are Keys, you need to obtain Values. It is important that you recognize the sample Values as you work through these procedures, then replace them with the Values that are specific to your use case. .

Amazon Web Services (AWS): Electric Cloud Compute (EC2) Setup . Preparing and AWS EC2 instance is the process of creating a cloud computer. This process starts by logging into your AWS IAM user, searching for EC2. . To get started, launch a new AWS EC2 instance to learn process and understand how to work with Linux. here are some key considerations. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the class will be using Ubuntu you should check on last verified version with a Teacher before proceeding | When it comes to picking memory or disk it is VERY important to pick Free Tier. As stated, this will only be used for testing and then it will be disposed for cost efficiency. | When presented with access dialog for http and https, make sure you check these boxes. Remember you are making a Web application that will run over http and https. | Name the security group (.pem) file after your team. It may be necessary to use SSH to access your EC2 instance. | The remainder of the steps you can use the defaults, refer to AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html | At the end of this process you need to “Connect to Instance”. This will provide you a terminal like experience. | . | . Update, Upgrade, and Install packages . Terminal commands are shown, these commands will be run from Terminal after you connect to your EC2 name. These commands update and then upgrade all your packages in your system. . $ sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade $ sudo apt install python3-pip nginx $ sudo pip3 install virtualenv . Clone and Change Directory to project location . This command move your Web Application code onto you EC2 cloud computer.The sample GithUb HTTPs Link is demonstration is: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git. . $ cd $ git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio.git $ cd flask_portfolio . Test Web Service . These steps will require you to understand a few new commands that will not be part of final deployment process. However, these commands will help you understand machine dependencies and validate your requirements.txt for completeness. . $ cd ~/flask_portfolio $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 webapp $ source webapp/bin/activate $ pip install -r requirements.txt $ python main.py .

Preparing the Docker Web Application for Internet Access . There are a couple of steps to this preparation. We need to direct the internet to the Server running the Web Application, this is done using Domain Name Service (DNS). After being directed to the Web Server, the server needs to respond to the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), this will be manged by Nginx. Additionally, we will be required to support Secure HTTP (HTTPS), a utility called Certbot will augment our Nginx configuration with a certificate. . DNS provider and setup . Each student scrum team is required to learn how to obtain a DNS provider and setup an independent domain. However, the final set up will be using a Subdomain under nighthawkcodingsociety.com. . A picture is included to show key elements in setting up a domain with a DNS provider. The nighthawkcodingsociety.com is using Freenom as its service provider. As you build your own DNS server you will need to obtain your own IP address and domain. . This illustration is dependent on… . EC2 Public IPs: 3.233.212.71 | DNS Name: nighthawkcodingsociety.com | DNS Subdomain name(s): battleship.nighthawkcodingsociety.com. cowboys.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | . A minimum configuration will have the two “A” type definitions using you Public IP address. These two are resolved with a single Web Application. The “CNAME” type is used for subdomains, these will resolve to a different Web Application. . &lt;img atl=”Setup a Domain” src=”/APCSP/images/freenom.png” title=”DNS Provider” . Nginx install, configuration, and services . Each student scrum team will perform Nginx installation and setup on an AWS EC2 test server. The final configuration will be on AWS server managed by Teachers or Student DevOps Engineers. . Enable Nginx to retrieve Python Web Application on internet request (Reverse Proxy)! Make a server file located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/nighthawk. . Install Nginx on Ubuntu servers $ sudo apt install nginx . | Go to location of Nginx server configuration files $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available . | Open editor to Create your own “Nginx server configuration” $ nano nighthawk . | Edit your own Nginx server configuration making modifications to: DNS Name(s): nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com | docker-compose, proxy pass Port: 8086 | . | . server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name nighthawkcodingsociety.com www.nighthawkcodingsociety.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8086; # Simple requests if ($request_method ~* &quot;(GET|POST)&quot;) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; } # Preflight requests if ($request_method = OPTIONS ) { add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot; *; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot; &quot;GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD&quot;; add_header &quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot; &quot;Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;; return 200; } } } . Activate/enabled Nginx server configuration: $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nighthawk /etc/nginx/sites-enabled $ sudo nginx -t . | If there are no errors, restart NGINX so the server is an endpoint to the internet: $ sudo systemctl restart nginx . | . Testing HTTP endpoint . Before finishing, this is a good opportunity to test everything you have done. . Direct Test of Web Application Endpoint. This should return HTML related to the home page of the Web site. If this fails, you need to review Docker and docker-compose configurations. $ curl http://localhost:8086; . | Testing unsecure HTTP endpoint on the internet. Go to a browser an type your DNS domain: http://nighthawkcodingsociety.com. Timeout. This means something is wrong with EC2 Public IP. | Nginx Default page. This means DNS is working, but something is wrong with you Nginx configuration. | Broken Gateway. This means Nginx is working, but something is wrong with Web Application endpoint on machine, if this fails something is wrong with Web Application. This requires you to look at Docker and docker-compose configuration. | . | . Certbot install and configuration . Each student scrum team will learn Certbot on on AWS EC2 test server, establish working https web application.

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) .

Tutorial: This is a Jupyter Notebook built using the JavaScript kernel. This provides a few fundamentals of JavaScript language. Pull this file into VSCode and explore the fundamentals of the language. | Calculator: This calculator was inspired by Mr. Mortensen’s calculator that he built in Objective-C during his first year of teaching at DNHS. It was recreated by former student Anthony using GitHub pages, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in 2022. Creating a calculator helps developers to learn how to store data, manage presentation, associate input to output, and work with logic | Visually shows how math works within a language; specific functions, handling of very big vs. very small numbers, etc. | . | Binary: This example was created after watching Harvard CS50 by David J.

Liquid is used to generate the HTML bits and parameters for onclick actions | JavaScript is used base 2, 8, 16 calculations | . | Grades: This grade calculator was created to show interaction of HTML and JavaScript to perform input. Additionally, it show how to add element to HTML Document Object Model (DOM). FYI, the IJavaScript kernel did not support input as of this writing. | Graph: This was created when a student named Bryant 2022 asked me the question “how would I plot data?” as described in an FRQ.

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",
