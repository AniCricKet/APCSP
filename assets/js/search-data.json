            "title": "College Board Pseudo Code",
            "content": "Learning College Board Pseudo Code . Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. College Board has designed a pseudo code, non operational programming language, to highlight concepts that it wants every student to learn. College Board pseudo code highlights instructions that are common for many languages. . BTW, instructions are translated into machine code for computers to execute. The notation we look at is supposed to be easy for the user and their application. For instance, many new languages are being popularized around data science. It is more important that a Data Scientist is successful in their task, than to learn syntax that is not familiar to their traditional workspace. . College Board is trying to remain neutral and build Computer Science Principles off of any language, thus the Teacher is left to pick the language(s) according to application and curriculum. . Comparison of CB Pseudo Code to Python with descriptions . Command Vocabulary | Pseudo code | Python | Purpose | . Output | DISPLAY(expression) | print(expression, end=” “) | Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. Python defaults to newline, thus the end=” “ | . Input | a ← INPUT() | a = input(prompt) | Accepts a value from the user and returns it to the variable a. | . Assignment | a ← expression | a = expression | Evaluates expression and assigns the result to the variable a. | . Selection | IF (expression) | if expression: | Run commands in the code block associated with the selection | . Iteration n times | REPEAT n TIMES | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times | . Iteration expression | REPEAT UNTIL (expression) | while expression: | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true | . List Assignment | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3] | list = [expression1, expression2, expression3] | Assigns 3 values to list, value can be literal or expressions | . First index in List | list[1] | list[0] | Access the 1st element in the list[]. FYI, most programming languages start a zero. | . Last index in List | list[LENGTH(list)] | list[len(list) - 1] | Access the last element in the list[]. If you start at zero, last element is length - 1. | . Define Procedure | PROCEDURE name (parameter) | def name(parameter): | Create a procedure containing a sequence of programming instructions. | . Expression equals | a = b | a == b | Evaluate if assigned value of a equals assigned value of b | . Expression not equals | a ≠ b | a != b | Evaluate if assigned value of a is NOT equal to assigned value of b | . Pseudo IF Code Block using curly braces . a ← 1 b ← 1 IF (a = b) { DISPLAY(&quot;A equals B&quot;) } . Python IF Code Block using indent . a = 1 b = 1 if (a == b): # Python uses indent to establish code block, Teacher use tab key print(&quot;A equals B&quot;) . Suggestions for students . It is very important that you become fluent in “Command Vocabulary” and “Purpose” of the Pseudo Code versus Python comparison. During the year you will look at JavaScript which has same Command Vocabulary and Purpose. Others may take Java, you will see the same ideas again. . Start building Vocabulary and Purpose by Code/Code/Coding | Supplement you Code with comments and outputs using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. This style allows you to code explore and learn as you go. | Use CB pseudo code as part of your definitions as you build your notebooks. | . Hacks . Build your own Notebook to highlight what you want to capture on pseudo code | Add a link in your Notebook to College Board pseudo code reference and other materials you find interesting by searching the internet | .",

            "title": "Anatomy of Python",
            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Python using print and input commands (aka anatomy). . Static print command and output . The classic introduction to a programming language is to output a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the print command. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Hello World! . Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable &quot;msg&quot; is part of both statement The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used to capture the input command | The variable &quot;msg&quot; is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal | . | The &quot;input&quot; command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the &quot;msg&quot; variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the &quot;msg&quot; variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . see you later . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The &quot;def question_and_answer(prompt)&quot; now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is &quot;question_and_answer&quot;. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three &quot;question_and_answer&quot; commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique &quot;prompt&quot; as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called &quot;prompt&quot;, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation &quot;+&quot; prefixes the prompt with the literal message &quot;Question: &quot;. | The &quot;msg&quot; variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input &quot;msg&quot; is output back to the user with &quot;Answer: &quot; concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see an ordered list of commands, what would you call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Question: Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson? Answer: print Question: If you see an ordered list of commands, what would you call it? Answer: sequence Question: Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function? Answer: def . Imports and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that are developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command in this example is used to evaluate a response?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains a &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) . Hello, johnmortensen running /usr/local/bin/python3 You will be asked 3 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? Answer: lets go!!! Question: What command is used to include other functions that are developed? import is correct! Question: What command in this example is used to evaluate a response? if is correct!

A successful grade is dependent on making mistakes, research, and iteration. | Suggestion. Please bring a personal laptop to class daily. The Internet and AP Classroom web site will be considered text book. | Requirements. Everything will be distributed electronically. All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. | Grading guidelines. There will be key technical objectives which will require producing tangibles. Essentially, it is impossible to be late with work if you work consistently attend class, work in class and turn in progressive tangibles each week. Thus, failure to have work will result in a 10% deduction. Additionally, late work must be defended in office hours. High “A” is very tough to achieve, something beyond the given tangible requirements. Something that exhibits an unforced desire to learn and Code/Code/Code. | Low “A” is consistency in producing tangibles toward Team Project and Individual GH Page according to Issues and Scrum Board plans. Plans must be consistent with key objectives and technicals. | “B” is having flaws in consistency or tangible shortcomings, but mostly on track. A flaw would be mostly working code, attempts, but incomplete. | “C” is a lack consistent effort, lacking tangibles. Lack of producing working Code. | Below “C” is composed of Slash/Slash/Slash offenses. Lack of attendance, disruptive behaviors, doing work from other classes during class time, paper visible in class, and turning in tangibles that you can’t represent in live review. | . | .

Laurie Santos is a professor at Yale has produced one of the most popular classes of all time at Yale (1 of 4 students take this class). . Teacher Notes . In my first watch of this video, right after 2021-2022 school year, these were my observations in improving the well being of Computer Science at Del Norte. . The Teacher needs to reduce academic stress on students. | The Teacher needs to convince Students to form habits of successful people, as discussed in the video. These habits need to be formed collaboratively between Teacher and Student. | Students need to strive to form an attitude of success for life. This takes effort and commitment. Similar to exercise analogies discussed in video. | In active discussions with Ms Naidu who taught at Del Norte in 2021-2022, we determined the biggest weakness in students our students is Collaboration, not Technical. | Laure Santos request that students be grateful for their current situation. | . Teacher Message . The AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte in 2022-2023 is structured to do most of the work in the classroom. Students, please prioritize the 4C habits: Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity in classroom. Additionally, focus, ask questions, Code/Code/Code, and make mistakes. If you do these things, you are in danger of getting 90% on all your assignments. . Agile and Psychology of the Good Life .

            "content": "Agile Methodology . . Agile software development uses practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with an Issues that that will be called a Review Ticket. The issue will be completed, it will reference Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. IIf you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do.. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration - Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment.

            "title": "TT 1.1.1 Fastpages - Tour of GH Pages / Fastpages",
            "content": "Tour of Fastpages . . GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Goggle documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsp.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging. Publish _notebook file | Publish _post file with image | Publish _docx file from Google Doc source | . | . Extra Credit . Consider re-designing and using your home page for this class and for other subjects, other than Computer Science. The searching and tagging features are very powerful and could help recall notes from any class. .",

            "title": "TT 1.0.0 - Tools and Equipment",
            "content": "Tools and Equipment make Development Easy . Learning Development tools, working with Projects, is the key to a rapid entry into Code/Code/Coding. A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. . Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. | GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. | Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. | . | Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies, IMO, to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. | Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”. | . Equipment, accounts and tools . A laptop, bring a laptop to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it. Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by PUSD. If you have any problems obtaining a Computer where you can install software!, please attend Office Hours immediately | GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to clone/push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code. | GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal web site, notes, and experiences. Review GitHub concepts 2-min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phGdqJB6ep0 | Jupyter Documents will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Java Code in to your Technical Notes. Review Jupyter basics 6-min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jZYC9rGrNg | Slack Account, install App on Laptop, get used to reading announcements. Slack is a messaging tool similar to Discord, the first year we had 35,000 message in a class. | Python is the key language you will be using in this class. Flask, Jinja2, HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning of coding. | VS Code is the code editor we will be using in this class. VSCode is more than and editor, it is called and Interactive Development Environment (IDE). | AWS Account for cloud computing and deployment, account access will be provided by Teacher. AWS Cloud Computing and Electric Cloud Computing (EC2’s) will be used to Deploy and Support projects on the Internet. | . GitHub Account . Follow instruction https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account | . MacOS 1st Time Developer (consider this an Introduction to Linux) . Install Homebrew from Terminal https://brew.sh Copy “bash … curl …” command using box on website | Launch Terminal from search bar and Paste “bash … curl …” command into Terminal … This will take a long time, 10-min, there will be a prompt in the middle about 5-minutes | At end you will see to long commands that you MUST Copy and Paste two into the terminal: “echo …” and “eval …”. Copy them as they are shown, they will not provide any feedback | Leave Terminal open | . | Install MacOS Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads Type brew command in terminal as shown on the website “brew install …”. This command will provide feedback and talk about 1-min. | . | . Windows 1st Time Developer . Install Windows Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads | . VSCode Installation and Setup . VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java Install the Coding Pack for Java | Install Extension Pack | Spring Boot Extension Pack | . | . VSCode Fastpages Project . Start Pages/Fastpages GitHub Repo from Template https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions Verify GitHub pages is running | VS Code Clone new GitHub Project | Push a minor “markdown” change and Verify on GitHub https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support | Verify “markdown” change on GitHub Pages | Create a new Jupyter notebook and publish to _notebooks directory https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks | . | . VSCode Marketplace and Extensions . . Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle. It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows. Before adding extensions, clone projects and see what is requested or added. Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added... . In marketplace there are several extensions for Python, Python for VSCode, Python Extension Pack&lt;/li&gt; Jupyter: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code | Code Spell Checker: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher. | IntelliCode: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension. Also, it help with syntax as you are coding. | &lt;/ul&gt; Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above. There is a lot more! As you need Git help look at things like Git History and GitLens. Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that. Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions. We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more. . . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ## Hacks Students need to demonstrate all these tools running to Scrum Team and then the Teacher. Issues need to be worked out quickly. Before asking Teacher ask 3 other students. Do not delay in Tool Setup task, there will be no late makeup for points!!! Tool and Equipment setup is like attendance, without Tools and Equipment you are effectually absent. - Show personal Fastpages / GitHub pages running on github.io - Start a new page in your Fastpages project using Markdown and HTML fragments ### College Board and CTE competencies Create Fastpages project in an Integrated Development Environment (VS Studio) | .",
