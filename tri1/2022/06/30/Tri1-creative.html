A development process includes ideation, research, reflection, design, implementation, and testing your program.

<p>In the Student handout… College Board states that Students need to obtain knowledge and skills that can include, but need not be limited to, “the iterative development process, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithm’s purpose and explaining how it functions. A development process includes ideation, research, reflection, design, implementation, and testing your program.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scrum Board planning, revising plans, incremental goals, and iterative development are proven methods toward achieving a successful delivery.</li>
  <li>Pair Share team needs to work together to optimize delivery to Teacher.</li>
  <li>Each student needs to become competent in HTML fragments, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python.</li>
  <li>Each student needs to learn and apply College Board requirements in “Unt 2: Data” and “Unit 3: Algorithms and Programming”.</li>
  <li>Web programming and JavaScript will be introduced during the process of creating this Pair Share project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pbl-ideation">
<a class="anchor" href="#pbl-ideation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PBL Ideation</h3>
<p>Start the process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  These are early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This should be done using Pair Programming.  You need to identify a Crossover Pair for reviews and grading.  Note, you will be graded on your grading.</li>
  <li>In this ideation process it is critical that you Review College Board Create Task project requirements.  For grading, you will be measured on how you are building knowledge toward that event.  As a pair you should consider this project as a viable option for your submittal.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pbl-prototyping">
<a class="anchor" href="#pbl-prototyping" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PBL Prototyping</h3>
<p>The process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  Early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One unique idea, aka something useful to your pair and/or something that helps you in school</li>
  <li>Show case work and labs from TPT and TT.</li>
  <li>A page that highlights YOU</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pbl-codecodecoding">
<a class="anchor" href="#pbl-codecodecoding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PBL Code/Code/Coding</h3>
<p>This is bringing Ideation and Prototyping into something that has function.  Remember, user College Board Create Task requirements if you are struggling on details.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#hacks---live-crossover-grade-before-monday-am" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hacks - Live Crossover Grade, before Monday AM.</h2>
<p>This is a big planning and prototype week,  Build all things into Scrum Board. Individuals demonstrate progress on assigned Issue(s) with tangibles.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter notebooks makes it easy to have tangible and working documents.</li>
  <li>Each Pair performs review with cross over who should be doing similar task, make adjustments before review with Teacher.</li>
  <li>Provide Crossover/Self grade at the top of the review ticket.  Anyone who rates above 90% should have something they have done outside of the requirements.</li>
  <li>Each pair should be prepared to complete review with Teacher in 2-4 minutes.</li>
</ul>
