<blockquote>
  <p>Idea is to have a course to focusses on freshman/sophomore classes. The purpose Computer Science and Software Engineering at Del Norte and PUSD, is to add to the beginning of the pathway that feeds into AP Computer Science Principles (CSP).  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNNVmkB1hV4Vh7V084HifSchucYB8LKiSgJA1CW9nlw/edit">Guide</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st trimester course is Game Design</li>
    <li>2nd trimester course is Game Design with an App Focus</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#accreditation-articulation-and-beyond" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accreditation, Articulation and Beyond</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>In discussion on titles, it seems vital to a High School Pathway that it leads beyond.  A key contributor to increasing Del Norte student participation in Computer Science, ~100 tto ~240, is the introduction of Computer Science Principles.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
<strong><em>Computer Science Principles has AP testing and UC accreditation</em></strong> as a 3rd Science, not just elective.</li>
    <li>
<strong><em>Computer Science “A” has AP testing and UC accreditation</em></strong> as a 4th Math, not just elective.</li>
    <li>
<strong><em>Data Structure 1&amp;2 with B or above graded will articulate to CS113 Data Structures.</em></strong>  There has been movement by Emily Stephenson, Del Norte and Mira Costa College regarding articulation. This begins with students taking CSP/DS1 in Fall of 2022, it completes with students finishing CSA/DSP2 in Summer of 2024, receiving credit for <a href="https://catalog.miracosta.edu/disciplines/computerscience/#courseinventory">CS113 – Data Structures</a>.</li>
    <li>
<strong><em>Beyond College</em></strong>, it seems the other “Big Thing” that High School Computer Science can do is to prepare students for internships and jobs.  Del Norte has been placing people regularly at Northrop Grumman (2 per year), UCSD Supercomputer (2 per year), Code Ninjas (2 per year).  Additionally, I have 2 reports of students Teaching in CompSci Labs on campus (Harvard and Mira Costa College).  Lastly, I have heard of a Purdue freshmen that is currently getting a Government clearance for internship in Summer 2023.  An absolute key is having projects published on GitHub!  The Purdue freshmen said the internship interviewer said “they reviewed projects on GitHub and new that he could code”. These opportunities seem to come because of Agile Methodology, Scrum, Python/Flask, Java/Spring, AWS, SQL, Linux, Anaconda, Docker, Nginx, GitHub.</li>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>CS 113: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

Units: 3
Prerequisites: CS 112.
Acceptable for Credit: CSU, UC
Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours.
Course Typically Offered: Fall, Spring, and Summer
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>The course uses topics of personal and social relevance to investigate the impact of computing through efficient algorithms and properly designed data structures. Students explore the software development process by developing effective solutions using industry-standard tools. Topics include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs. C-ID COMP-132.</li>
